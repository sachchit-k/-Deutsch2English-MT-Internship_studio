## Machine Translation Project: Deutsch to English

This GitHub repository focuses on a machine translation project that aims to translate text from Deutsch (German) to English. The project utilizes various techniques and approaches to achieve accurate and meaningful translations. The following components are covered:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is prepared by performing data cleaning, normalization, and tokenization. These steps ensure that the input data is in a suitable format for machine translation models.

2. **Model Development**: The project implements a machine translation model using deep learning techniques, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models. These models are trained on a large corpus of Deutsch-English parallel data to learn the mapping between the two languages.

3. **Ensemble Techniques**: Ensemble methods may be employed to improve translation quality by combining multiple models or variations of the same model. Ensemble techniques help mitigate individual model biases and enhance translation accuracy.

4. **Dimensional Reduction**: Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), may be applied to reduce the complexity of the data and extract essential features. This process can improve translation accuracy and speed.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: The project employs evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) to assess the quality of the translations. BLEU measures the similarity between machine-generated translations and human-generated reference translations, providing an objective evaluation of the model's performance.

6. **Documentation and Resources**: The repository provides comprehensive documentation, including explanations of the implemented techniques, insights into machine translation challenges, and references to relevant research papers. Additionally, it offers resources for further exploration and understanding of machine translation concepts.

By exploring this repository, users can gain insights into the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of machine translation from Deutsch to English. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts interested in understanding and implementing machine translation systems effectively.

This GitHub repository contains code for a machine translation project focused on translating text from Deutsch (German) to English. The following code snippet showcases some key functionalities:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Check TensorFlow version
print(tf.__version__)

# Load the pre-trained model
model = load_model('model.1234')

# Reshape test data
testX = testX.reshape(testX.shape[0], testX.shape[1])
testY = testY.reshape(testY.shape[0], testY.shape[1])

# Perform predictions
preds = model.predict(testY).astype("int32")

# Define helper functions
def get_word(n, tokenizer):
    for word, index in tokenizer.word_index.items():
        if index == n:
            return word
    return word

# Tokenization
tok = Tokenizer(char_level=True)

# Reverse word mapping
reverse_word_map = dict(map(reversed, tokenizer.word_index.items()))

# Convert predictions to text
preds_text = []
for i in preds:
    temp = []
    for j in range(len(i)):
        t = get_word(i[j].all(), eng_tokenizer)
        if j > 0:
            if t == get_word(i[j-1].all(), eng_tokenizer):
                temp.append(t)
            else:
                temp.append('')
    preds_text.append(' '.join(temp))

# Decode sequences
def decode_sequences(tokenizer, length, lines):
    seq = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts(lines)
    return seq

words = decode_sequences(eng_tokenizer, eng_length, preds)

# Create DataFrame with predicted translations
pred_df = pd.DataFrame({'actual': test[:, 0], 'predicted': words})

# Display DataFrame
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 200)
```

This repository aims to provide an end-to-end solution for Deutsch to English translation using machine learning techniques. It includes code examples, documentation, and resources for better understanding and implementation of machine translation models.
